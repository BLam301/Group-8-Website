          <h3>3D Art and Graphic Design</h3>
          <p>I have always been fascinated by the power of visual communication and how it can convey ideas and emotions in a way that words sometimes cannot, to have the ability to create worlds, art and visuals completely out of my imagination is something which appeals deeply to me. That's why I have developed a deep interest in 3D art and graphic design, which allow me to express my creativity and bring my ideas to life.</p>

          <h3>Programming</h3>
          <p>Programming has always been a source of fascination for me, ever since I first learned how to code a simple "Hello, World!" program. The ability to create something out of nothing using just a few lines of code is an amazing feeling that never gets old.</p>
          <p>Overall, my interests in programming reflect my love of creativity, problem-solving, and innovation. I'm always eager to learn new languages, frameworks, and technologies, and I'm constantly seeking out new challenges and opportunities to apply my skills. For me, programming isn't just a hobby or a career choice it's a way of life.</p>
