            <h3>Introduction:</h3>
            <p>
                Hello everyone, my name is Zih, and I am currently a sophomore majoring in Computer Science but I plan on switching my major to Informatics.
                I live in John Quincy Adams located in the Southwest Residential area. Additionally, I also founded and run People's Beauty Supply which is
                a black hair care stand located inside People's Market in our student union.
	            Iâ€™m currently taking INFO101 in order to satisfy a requirement for the Informatics major.
                Hope you enjoyed these fun facts about me!
            </p>

            <h3>Informatics Major:</h3>
            <p>
                I started off freshman year doing computer science and I didn't really connect with it so I talked to my advisor and she suggested Informatics
               and after further research I decided to give it a chance and I find the course material much more interesting than CS. So come this fall I will officially be in the major!
            </p>


            <h3>People's Beauty Supply</h3>

               I contacted the center for student's with businesses in the summer of '22 to see if I could put a beauty supply vending machine in the
               school to cater to the haircare needs of black students on campus, but they said a vending machine would not be possible. However, a woman
               named Mary was sympathetic to the lack of haircare items available in the Amherst Area and suggested that I create a stand and put it in
               People's Market. So over the summer and all of fall semester we talked and in March of this year we were finally able to unveil the stand!
            </p>
            
            <h3>Hobbies:</h3>
            <p>
                Watching television, hanging out with friends, listening to music, cooking, and trying new restaurants are some of my favorite hobbies.
            </p>


   


            <h5>Childhood</h5>

                I was born in Boston but grew up in Malden/Everett. I was a very active child. As seen in the photo; I enjoyed being outside
                whether it was bike riding, swimming, tennis, going to the park, etc.
            </p>


 


            <h3>Why am I taking Informatics 101?</h3>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 1in;">
                In addition to needing the class as a core requirement for the Informatics major. I think upon graduation I would like to explore a career in
               Web Design and the work we've been doing with HTML such as this project is giving me the hands on experience that I need.
