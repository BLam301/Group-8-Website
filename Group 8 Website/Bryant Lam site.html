            <h3>Introduction:</h3>
            <p>
                Hello everyone, my name is Bryant, and I am a sophomore majoring in Japanese language and literature with a minor in IT.
                I live in Lewis Hall which is located in the Northeast Residential area. I’m a part of TASC,
                a chinese yoyo and dragon dance performance group based here in UMass. I’m currently taking INFO101 in order to satisfy a requirement for my IT minor.
                I have many different hobbies and if any of you are also interested, feel free to come talk to me!
            </p>

            <h3>Japanese Major:</h3>
            <p>
                <image src="Flag_of_Japan.png" alt="flag of Japan" width="250" height="168" style="float: left; margin-right: 20px;">
                I was previously majoring in electrical engineering but found that it simply wasn’t for me.
                I have always had a deep interest in the Japanese language and its culture and decided to take a chance at the major.
                All of the Japanese courses are super fun and interesting, and I am planning on studying abroad during my senior year. 
            </p>

            <h3>TASC:</h3>
            <p>

                TASC is an arts and media RSO that focuses on traditional Chinese performing arts, most notably Chinese yoyo and dragon dance.
                If you’ve ever been to events on campus such as Many Voices, KSA’s Streets of Seoul, or TCSA’s Cultural Night Market,
                you may have seen one of our performances. If you’ve never seen one of our performances before, I highly recommend you check out our youtube channel:

            <h3>Hobbies:</h3>
            <p>
                Along with chinese yoyo, some of my other hobbies include regular yoyo, balisong, and video games. 
            </p>

            <h5><em>Chinese Yoyo:</em></h5>
            <p>
                <image src="https://imgur.com/UjrDpHd.gif" alt="Diabolo GIF" width="390" height="250" style="float: right; margin-left: 20px;">
                Chinese yoyo, also known as diabolo, is essentially just a much bigger version of the yoyo except the yoyo is not attached to the string, 
                it is instead manipulated in the air using a string attached to two sticks. I first picked it up in the spring of last year when I first joined TASC. I was a
                complete beginner at first, but I was able to learn extremely fast thanks to my fellow club members' help. 
            </p>

            <h5><em>Yoyo:</em></h5>
            <p>
                <image src="https://imgur.com/og2aopC.gif" alt="Yoyo GIF" width="275" height="250" style="float: left; margin-right: 20px;">
                Like many other kids, I started playing with yoyos when I was a kid, but I lost interest once I realized that I was really bad at it. But in middle school, 
                I saw a youtube video of modern-style yoyoing; they weren’t just making the yoyo go up and down, but they were also manipulating the string in intricate ways 
                to make really cool and interesting tricks. 
            </p>

            <h5><em>Balisong:</em></h5>
            <p>
                <image src="https://imgur.com/H9Ocjbm.gif" alt="Balisong GIF" width="250" height="250" style="float: right; margin-left: 20px;">
                Balisongs, also known as butterfly knives, is a hobby that I have picked up quite recently. It involves a knife or trainer blade with two folding handles 
                that the user can flip and spin in flashy and fascinating ways to close or open the knife. You may be familiar with balisongs if you’ve ever played games 
                such as Counterstrike or Valorant. 
            </p>

            <h5><em>Video Games:</em></h5>
            <p>

                You will frequently find me playing video games in my spare time. Some of my favorite video games are single player JRPGs (Japanese Role Playing Games) such as 
                the Yakuza series and Nier: Automata.
            </p>

            <h3>Why am I taking Informatics 101?</h3>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 1in;">
                I'm taking this class not only to satisfy a requirement for my IT minor, but also to gain a deeper understanding for how websites, networks, and technology as a 
                whole work together to make our lives easier and more efficient. This class has helped me learn the basics of web design and refresh my skills in Python.
