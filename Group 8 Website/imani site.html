            <h3>Introduction:</h3>
            <p>
                Hi! My name is Imani and I'm a sophomore at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. I am a Public Health Major minoring in IT and
                I live in Crampton Hall which is located in the Southwest Residential Area. I live in Middle Sex County about an hour and forty minutes away from here. 
                I am involved in a couple things here at Umass such as B.A.S.I.C, ASA, and an undergraduate research lab called Equity Transitions to Adulthood.
                Outside of school and academics I enjoy spending time with my family and friends, nature, poetry, creative outlet, and other things. 
            </p>

            <h3>BASIC:</h3>
            <p>
                <image src="BASIC logo.jpg" alt="BASIC" width="250" height="250" style="float: left; margin-right: 20px;">
                BASIC, (Brothers and Sisters in Christ), is faith based club here at Umass. This club is where Christians or those who are curious to what it means
                to have a relationship with Jesus, especially relating to campus life, are able to come together. This club is essentially a way for individuals
                to come together and form a community through events, Sunday services, and Bible studies. 
            </p>

            <h3>ASA:</h3>
            <p>

                <image src="ASA logo.jpg" alt="ASA" width="250" height="250" style="float: right; margin-left: 20px;">
                ASA, also known as the African Student Association, is a club here at Umass where Africans across campus can come together and connect with one another.
                The African population here at Umass is very small. As a Kenyan on this campus, I have found that the Umass ASA has helped me find and build
                relationships with people who not only look like me, but those who have lived and shared similar experiences with me as well.
            </p>

            <h3>ETA:</h3>
            <p> 
                This semester I decided to conduct undergraduate research. The research lab I am working on is called ETA: Equity Transitions to Adulthood. I am one of 
                the founding researchers of this lab. In this lab, we are researching ways in which we can change and enforce higher education policies to 
                to aid the college secession of minority students.

            <h3> Outside Academics:</h3>

                <image src="imani_nature_poetry_picture.jpeg" alt="Outside Academics" width="188" height="250" style="float: left; margin-right: 20px;">
                In my free time I enjoy spending time with my family and friends, reading and writing poetry, spending time in nature, traveling, 
                and listening to music.
